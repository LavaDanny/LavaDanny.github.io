      <p>
          I am a senior at the University of Rhode Island. I am majoring in Computer Engineering with
          a minor in Mathematics and Computer Science. I've always been interested in computers since I built my first one in the 7th grade.
          It was a no brainer to pursue Computer Engineering after high school. My current interests lie in computer vision, 
          speech processing and machine learning but I am willing to work in other areas while I get my career off the ground.
          Some hobbies I enjoy include video games, basketball, and music. Feel free to look around the site and contact me
          with the information at the bottom of the page.

      <p>
        During my career I would like to try and make programs and products that will affect many people in a positive way.
        My goal is to make a difference in the world and be renowned for an achievement I will produce in the future. 
        The first step to this starts with my first job and gaining the experience and knowledge necessary of a field in order to 
        make such a difference. Maybe one day I'll even have my own Wikipedia page.
